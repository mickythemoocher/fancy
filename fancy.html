<I>The scene is a comfortable sitting room.<P>.</I><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF"> Good afternoon Albert, you are looking very comfortable in that big old chair. Can I get you a coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  I was just about to get myself one, but thank you.  That is very kind of you Ali.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF"> I get a coffee for the man with the brain, when I was the boxer I got the pain. ( a little laugh.)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> I don't wish to be unkind Ali but your poems were never very good when you were alive. They have not improved one bit since you have been dead.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> I must admit, nobody ever bothered to put them in a book.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  You were a great and talented boxer Ali, you can't expect to be good at everything.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok, maybe my poems aren't great but I still float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes. Indeed you do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Here is your coffee Albert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Thank you, come and sit here, you are making me feel dizzy with all of that prancing about.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, take the weight off my feet. Quiet here today.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, but we are a little bit early, some others will be along presently.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Tell me Albert, do you ever get the feeling that you changed the world?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Ha, no, never. I may have changed a few minds but no more than that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  I think people will remember you long after they have forgotten me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Only time will tell.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  Hello boys, how are you today?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Marilyn, how delightful to see you my dear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Mwahhh â€“ There a little kiss on that very, very clever forehead.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Afternoon Marilyn, do I get a kiss too?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> If you would be gracious enough to get me a coffee Ali I will seriously consider it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  I won the world heavyweight championship on three separate occasions and now I just fetch coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  None of us are what we were Ali<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> That is true enough. I like it here though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  Me too, it is far less painful.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> There are things that I miss but many things that I don't.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  I don't miss anything.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Yeh Marilyn, I get that, you had some bad moments, here is your coffee sweetheart.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Thank you Ali, bend down and let me put a little kiss on your forehead too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  Ahh perfect<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Mwahh<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Hello, hello, greetings to you all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Good afternoon sir, I am so glad you could join us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> The pleasure, of course, is all mine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  Come sit next to me, plenty of room here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Thank you my child but I really do prefer to sit over here on the rug.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  I am the coffee boy today Mat. Can I get you one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  Just water for me, if it is not too much trouble.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> No trouble at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> So have I missed any excitement?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Just one of my poems.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Which wasn't very exciting at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> And Albert was showing his modesty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Was I?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  Yeh. Saying that you never made any changes in the world. I think you did<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn</font color="#0000FF"> . Yes! So do I. You were the cleverest man alive.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Do not believe all you read in the papers.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  Hmmm yes, that is certainly true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> All beings, in some way or another left there mark on the world. For good or bad.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Here is your water Mat. I agree with that but I still think some leave a bigger mark than others.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Marilyn my dear, I think it will be a long time before people forget you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Nonsense. I was just a silly blonde actress<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> No my child, you were far, far more than that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Maybe we were all far more than we realised.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Or far less perhaps<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  That is more likely Ali.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> (a little shyly)Errr..... Hello everyone<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Hello my dear, come on in.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Hello. Are you new here?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I just arrived.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF"> Welcome then. What's your name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Stephanie, pleased to meet you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  Pleased to meet you too my dear, come on through and take a seat.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  Thank you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Would you like some coffee Stephanie? It has just been brewed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh yes, thank you, that would be nice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> So let me explain my dear, us four normally meet here each afternoon for coffee and you would be more than welcome to join us any time you choose.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie.</font color="#0000FF">  Thank you. That's very kind.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  It would be a pleasure to have your company.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Thank you. I am still kind of finding my way around.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> It doesn't take long honey.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> You will soon feel very comfortable here. It is a uniquely peaceful place.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes I can tell, I already feel very much at peace.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> So do we need to introduce ourselves to you Stephanie?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Well, err, I am not sure. Is that what people normally do here?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> To be honest, there is no normally really. People just do as they see fit.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> I just asked that Stephanie as I don't recognise you. Not that it is of any importance.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Of no importance at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> As I said, I have just arrived here, so I suppose that is why you don't recognise me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> I think Marilyn may be teasing you my dear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> ( a little giggle) No Albert, I wouldn't do that. I was just interested.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh! Oh my goodness! You said Marilyn? Of course. How silly of me. You are Marilyn Monroe? You are aren't you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes I am. Or rather I was.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> I am so sorry. I didn't recognise you at first.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Absolutely no need to apologise honey.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Who we were or what we did counts for very little here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  I would go further and say it counts for nothing at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> And that suits us all just fine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Now we are all just what we are and nothing more.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> And you sir. I know I recognise you. Not that I ever met you. I mean from pictures and things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes Stephanie, this is professor Albert Einstein.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie.</font color="#0000FF">  I knew I recognised the face. You were a scientist weren't sir?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  A theoretical Physicist actually but it really was of no importance, it was just a job.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> You are too modest Al, it was far more than just a job and you know it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> He invented loads of things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> (Laughing). No, not at all my dear boy. I never invented a single thing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  You achieved so much though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> He was a genius my dear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> So people say. All I did was discover things. Which meant they were there all along, it just needed someone to point them out.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  As Marilyn said Albert, you are far too modest.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> If my genius were as great as Marilyn's beauty then I would have been a true genius indeed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Ha! Beauty! How important is that? Not important at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> You gave such pleasure to so many people Marilyn.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> That is so true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  All so superficial. I was just an actor, and not a very good one at that. It was just that I was right for the moment.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  I loved all your movies. I was so in love with you Marilyn even though we had never met.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> I believe so many men were in love with her.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  No. Not in love with me Steph. In love with my image. Whether it were on celluloid or newsprint. That is what they were in love with. Not with me. Not with the real Norma Jean. Arthur did love me for a while I believe but just a fleeting instant.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> That is sad.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> But the way of the world I am afraid.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  I am sorry sir but I am not sure who you are. Were you also famous?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Ha ha. Famous indeed!The most revered of us all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Nonsense.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  He freed a lot of people. And I knew a lot about people that needed to be free.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  You did indeed Ali.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Mahatma, so many people owed you so much for the freedom you gave them<p>.
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> I gave them no freedom Albert. I just help them to find the way to it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> And that is not an easy task. I admired the way you lived so simply. Maybe I regret that. That I didn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  You were a very successful and wealthy man Ali.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  You must have been rich too sir, discovering all of those important things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  Not rich my dear, but comfortable, as they say. Unlike my friend Mahatma who had nothing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Ha ha ha Not true my dear Albert. At the time of my death I had the princely sum of $1.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> I apologise my friend. Riches beyond the dreams of avarice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Riches do not always mean money.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> That is what my mum always told me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> And she was right my child.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  My admiration for you Ali was not as a boxer but as a man.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh! You were a boxer?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> A very famous and successful boxer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  I am sorry, I know nothing about boxing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> And nor do I but Ali used his fame to help others.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  I just did what I felt.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  You rebelled against war and against racial prejudice. Your voice was heard.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> The world was wrong.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  And it still is.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Only half of your life was as a boxer Ali, and the  profound conviction that you had an even bigger fight against inhumanity was a far greater threat to your rivals than to your boxing opponents.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> But was it? Was it a threat? Maybe I made no difference at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  You made a difference Ali. You used your power for good and there were many people on Earth that could not say that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  And all I did was pout a little and sing in a sultry voice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> Well, well, well my dear. You may have kept secrets on Earth but here we know all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma</font color="#0000FF"> : Indeed we do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn:</font color="#0000FF">  I have no idea what you are talking about.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> I do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  What? What is it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert: </font color="#0000FF"> As Marilyn said herself, earlier. Most people only knew the image they saw on the screen but the real Marilyn, Norma Jean, for that was her real name, may surprise you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  She was such a generous woman<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh please don't, it was nothing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert;</font color="#0000FF">  She gave a great deal of money to children's charities, particularly to children's hospitals. She helped people with crippling diseases and much more.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> And she also left 25% of her estate to help people with psychiatric problems.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh gosh! Really?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes really.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> It was only money. Mahatma, you gave your whole life to helping people.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  It helped me even more.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> So, Stephanie. We have all introduce ourselves in way way or another.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali:</font color="#0000FF">  Or each other, so what about you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh gosh! I am absolutely floored to be in such company. I really do not know what to say. You are all so famous.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  I believe fame is more or less an accident<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali: </font color="#0000FF"> I would agree with that. I refused to be drafted into the army to fight in Vietnam. I was stripped of my boxing titles as a result of that. I guess at that time I came close to giving up boxing, and the fame that went with it. I didn't box for over four years after that but I did keep on fighting, fighting injustice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma:</font color="#0000FF">  And I suppose I could have remained an unknown lawyer in South Africa.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marilyn: </font color="#0000FF"> There are thousands of actresses that never get the chances I did. I was lucky.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  At 16, I failed the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich. A great disappointment to me. I suppose it was only luck that made me persevere.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> So you see Stephanie, fame is really not that important.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Stephanie:</font color="#0000FF">  But I am so ordinary. I never did anything to be famous. Even if it is unimportant. I was just an ordinary nurse in an ordinary hospital<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mahatma: </font color="#0000FF"> Stephanie, A truly wonderful and caring profession. I would say that you are perhaps the most famous of us all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ali, Marilyn and Albert:</font color="#0000FF">  (together) I agree<p>
